# Slides for the Presentation on the Basic concepts of Git

The slides are in German, they were used during the [Ophase 2024](https://www.fachschaft.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/studium/anfaenger/owo).

To build these slides, use [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp):
Run `marp git.md` on a system with a working Marp installation.

The [flake](flake.nix) provides a devshell for writing the slides.
